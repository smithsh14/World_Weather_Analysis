# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6 Challenge: WeatherPy with Python APIs

## Background
The PlanMyTrip app was a huge hit! So much so, we have been asked to expand upon it by adding a few details including adding the weather desctiption to the weather data, inlcuding input statements to filter the data for users based on their personal weather preferences, and allows users to create an itinerary based on the users input of for cities. This will allow a final output by creating a travel route between the four cities they chose with a marker layer map included. 

## Deliverables
### Deliverable 1
For this deliverable we were tasked with retrieving the weather data utilizing an API call.
- The items for this deliverable as found in the "Weather_database" folder are as follows:
  - The Weather_Database.ipynb file
  - The WeatherPy_Database.csv file

### Deliverable 2
For this deliverable we were tasked with creating a custom travel desitnation map that included a pop-up marker utilizing the hotels within cities.
- The items for this deliverable as found in the "Vacation_Search" folder are as follows:
  - The Vacation_Search.ipynb file
  - The WeatherPy_vacation.csv file
  - The WeatherPy_vacation_map.png image

### Deliverable 3
For this deliverable we were tasked with creating the final piece, a travel itinerary map based on four cities within a country. For this deliverable we used the following four cities within the United States...
1) Mango, Louisana
2) Houma, Louisana
3) Estelle, Florida
4) San Antonio, Texas
- The items for this deliverable as found in the "Vacation_Itinerary" folder are as follows:
  - The Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb file
  - The WeatherPy_travel_map.png image
